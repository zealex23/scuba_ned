Hook and Introduction

Main Points to Cover:

Intro: 
When things go wrong during a dive, the outcomes are serious, and potentially fatal. One main reason a dive ends in a morgue is not the situation itself, but the state of panicked thinking which causes a diver to act in unintelligible ways. A simple command is generally enough to allow panicked people to operate in a stable manner, and the idealized system has been used by fighter pilots for years, is now marketed to motorcyclists, and with any hope, the Heads up Display will be saving the lives of recreational divers in the coming months. 

Imagine a diver getting back into the water after several years, without a refresher course (since he believes he can recall the information). Out of practice, in a wetsuit perhaps too thin for the water, and fighting a current the entire dive, he realizes he burned through his air supply faster than intended. At 70 feet, he has perhaps 2 minutes left (which at about 30-40 heâ€™ll have 8 minutes left due to a change in pressure). Inhaling at this depth, has resistance due to low tank pressure, and he panics. He rockets to the surface, oblivious to the expansion of air in his tank, still assuming he only has 120 seconds left. Upon breaking the surface, he suffers a fatal embolism. 


Problem Statement
=================
Conventional dive computers display too much information for divers to manage under stress.
Additionally, this information is kept out of view most of the time, including when it is needed most.

Current near eye and head up displays for divers have a wide range of problems.
- They are all expensive, 
- Some require special equipment
- Some interfere with normal dive procedures such as removing and replacing masks
- None prioritize information to reduce cognitive load on the diver

Solution Statement
==================
Our solution is a dive computer with a Head-Up-Display that keeps essential information in view of the diver
at all times, and also prioritizes this information to reduce the cognitive load on the divers.
Having this information in view constantly prevents mistakes that lead to serious accidents,
and prioritizing this information help stressed divers deal with their situation more effectively.

Execution
=========
Our design goals for this project are that it
- Be unintrusive
- Be completely distinct from and compatible with any other piece of equipment
- Be suitable for traditional open circuit recreational divers

We will meet these goals by mounting the computer on the divers mask, rather than a 
rebreather hose like some current solutions.  The computer will be mounted on the diver's
mask strap, like a snorkle, and will have a set of optics extending forward into the 
divers field of view.  The optics will be stabilized in front of the diver using 
neodynium magnets.

The Ask
=======
In principle our idea is very simple, so a prototype could be built very cheaply.
But since a dive computer is a piece of life-support equiptment, production units 
will need to undergo rigorous testing and certification to be ready for prime-time.


Conclusion

How might our diver's story have been different if he had
