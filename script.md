Story about diver dying.

Problem Statement
=================
Conventional dive computers display too much information for divers to manage under stress.
Additionally, this information is kept out of view most of the time, including when it is needed most.

Current near eye and head up displays for divers have a wide range of problems.
- They are all expensive, 
- Some require special equipment
- Some interfere with normal dive procedures such as removing and replacing masks
- None prioritize information to reduce cognitive load on the diver

Solution Statement
==================
Our solution is a dive computer with a Head-Up-Display that keeps essential information in view of the diver
at all times, and also prioritizes this information to reduce the cognitive load on the divers.
Having this information in view constantly prevents mistakes that lead to serious accidents,
and prioritizing this information help stressed divers deal with their situation more effectively.

Execution
=========
Our design goals for this project are that it
- Be unintrusive
- Be completely distinct from and compatible with any other piece of equipment
- Be suitable for traditional open circuit recreational divers

We will meet these goals by mounting the computer on the divers mask, rather than a 
rebreather hose like some current solutions.  The computer will be mounted on the diver's
mask strap, like a snorkle, and will have a set of optics extending forward into the 
divers field of view.  The optics will be stabilized in front of the diver using 
neodynium magnets.

The Ask
=======
In principle our idea is very simple, so a prototype could be built very cheaply.
But since a dive computer is a piece of life-support equiptment, production units 
will need to undergo rigorous testing and certification to be ready for prime-time.


Conclusion
==========
How might our diver's story have been different if he had
