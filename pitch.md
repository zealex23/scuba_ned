- hook
    - Tell story of diver not monitoring his dime time remaining
            rocketing to surface and dying.
- problem statement
    - Current dive computers present too much information for divers under stress to manage well.
    - This information is out of view most of the time, incuding when it's needed most.

- solution statement
    - existing solutions 
        - all expensive
	- not suitable for traditional, recreational divers
            - Sherwater NERD: mounted on CCR hose
        - Mask with built in HUD: cannot swap masks
        - intrusive, blocks fov defeating purpose of diving.

    - sHUD - head up/augmented reality display for scuba divers.
	    - prioritizes and keeps essential information in view at all times, reducing cognative
		load and preventing procedural errors.
	    - Very unintrusive, small combiner glass is the only thing the diver sees.

- executing
    - design goals
        - suitable for open circuits rec. divers
            - sherwater: no CCR hose
            - not prohibitively expensive
        - distinct unit
            - not built into mask
        - non-intrusive
            - does not interfere with normal procedures, such as swapping or replacing mask
            - small fov
    - implementation
        - main unit attached to mask strap like snorkel
        - computer measures and prioritizes information
        - optics present contents of small oled display into divers FOV
        - display stabilized with neodynium magnets on either side of mask glass
        - TODO: diagram

- the ask
    - money to develop
        - prototype cheap, but production unit needs testing, certification etc.

- conclusion
    - Tell same story, but diver uses our solution and survives.
