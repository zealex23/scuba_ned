- hook
    - boredom punctuated by moments of terror
    - so is scuba, but without the boredom
- problem statement
    - "Procedural errors, compounded by large cognative loads at critical phases of
        a dive result in divers suffering injury and death."
    - "existing solutions are all expensive, in addition not suitable for OC divers"
        - Sherwater NERD: mounted on CCR hose
        - Mask with built in HUD: cannot swap masks
- solution statement
    - sHUD - head up/augmented reality display for scuba divers.
    - prioritizes and keeps essential information in view at all times, reducing cognative
        load and preventing procedural errors.
    - TODO: have conceptual drawing.
- executing
    - design goals
        - suitable for open circuits rec. divers
            - no CCR hose
            - not prohibitively expensive
        - distinct unit
            - not built into mask
        - non-intrusive
            - does not interfere with normal procedures, such as swapping or replacing mask
            - small fov
    - implementation
        - main unit attached to mask strap like snorkel
        - computer measures and prioritizes information
        - optics present contents of small oled display into divers FOV
        - display stabilized with neodynium magnets on either side of mask glass
        - TODO: diagram
- the ask
    - money to develop
        - prototype cheap, but production unit needs testing, certification etc.
